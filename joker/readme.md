# SPA WEB APP - Based on Foundation for Apps

This is a school project, a single page web application, created with Foundation for Apps, powered by Gulp, Angular, and libsass. It has Dynamic Routing built with Templates and Views. Please notice! not complete, still work in progress.

## Requirements

You'll need the following software installed to get started.

  - [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer for your OS.
  - [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads): Use the installer for your OS.
    - Windows users can also try [Git for Windows](http://git-for-windows.github.io/).
  - [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `npm install -g gulp bower`
    - Depending on how Node is configured on your machine, you may need to run `sudo npm install -g gulp bower` instead, if you get an error with the first command.

## Get Started

Clone this repository, where `joker` is the name of your app. Or download Zip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maggelino/webapp-joker.git joker
```

Change into the directory.

```bash
cd joker
```

Install the dependencies. If you're running Mac OS or Linux, you may need to run `sudo npm install` instead, depending on how your machine is configured.

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

While you're working on your project, run:

```bash
npm start
```

This will compile the Sass and assemble your Angular app. **Now go to `localhost:8080` in your browser to see it in action.** When you change any file in the `client` folder, the appropriate Gulp task will run to build new files.

To run the compiling process once, without watching any files, use the `build` command.

```bash
npm start build
```
